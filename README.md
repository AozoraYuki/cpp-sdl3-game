# 2D Game Engine Demo (C++ / SDL3)

Status: Work in Progress – This project is currently under active development.

A 2D game developed from scratch in C++ using SDL3, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer.  
Originally inspired by a tutorial series, will be extended with custom features, improved architecture, and additional gameplay elements.

## 🎮 Features
- Basic game loop with event handling, rendering, and frame timing.
- Sprite loading and texture management using SDL_image.
- Sound effects and background music support with SDL_mixer.
- Collision detection and simple physics.
- Modular code structure with CMake build system.
- Custom gameplay mechanics added beyond the tutorial.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++17**
- **SDL3**
- **SDL_image**
- **SDL_mixer**
- **CMake**

## 🚀 Building and Running
